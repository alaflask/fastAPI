Zopa takes on such responsibilities as distributing money between parties, completing the legal paperwork, performing borrower identity/credit checks, and employing a collections agency that chases missed payments for the lender. Zopa also mitigates risk for lenders by enforcing monthly direct debit repayment, making borrowers sign a legal contract, and allowing lenders to lend small chunks of money to individual borrowers (i.e. someone lending Â£1000 would have their money spread across say, 100 borrowers). The company itself makes money by charging a fixed fee for borrowers and a 1% annual fee for lenders.

"Finance, Financial Services, FinTech, Wealth Management","New York, New York, United States",371,"Yieldstreet is a management platform that provides institutional investors with access to income-generating investment products. Founded in 2015, Yieldstreet gives individuals access to alternative investments that have traditionally been off-limits to the average investor. With over $2.5 billion invested across multiple asset classes, Yieldstreet is changing the way people generate passive income by lowering and removing the barriers that historically kept these lucrative opportunities far out of reach.  In 2013, founders Milind Mehere and Michael Weisz were frustrated that many investment strategies were typically reserved only for institutions and the ultra-wealthy. Typically, the average investor was left to choose between the stock market and bonds with falling yields - with few options in between. Asset-based investments had longer hold periods and a higher barrier of entry, keeping them well out of reach of accredited investors — even more so for unaccredited investors. As a result, they decided to leverage the growing fintech disruption to give more people access to these previously restricted alternative investments.  Milind’s background in building companies, combined with Michael’s decade-plus experience within investing and fund management, formed the core of Yieldstreet. Passion for their investors and employees, as well as a willing embrace of innovation, has been part of Yieldstreet’s identity from the beginning. Each decision to leverage a new technology, investment strategy, or originate a new deal is made with the goal of putting investors first.  That drive has propelled Yieldstreet across all 50 states, crossing $100M invested in less than eight quarters, with the $1B milestone coming only three years later. In 2019, Yieldstreet’s membership had grown to 100,000, and a savings account for members was launched.  Yieldstreet, since its launch in 2015, has not deviated from its goal to change investing for the better, nor has it slowed down. Yieldstreet was ranked as number 46 on the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing companies and has been recognized by Built In as one of the Best Places to Work. Yieldstreet today delivers wealth generation options and alternative investments for more than 330,000 investors and has returned more than $1.3 billion in principal/interest.  Many alternative investment platforms only focus on one asset class, such as real estate or art. Yieldstreet’s offerings, accessed through cash or a low-fee IRA, cover a wide range of asset classes — art, real estate, legal, corporates, consumer, and commercial, via single investments or funds. Yieldstreet also offers its members short-term notes on offerings with a hold period between 3 and 6 months, which generally boast higher interest rates than money markets and CDs.  Yieldstreet is headquartered in New York and has offices in Brazil, Greece, and Malta. Michael Weisz serves as President and Milind Mehere serves as CEO. Together, they manage a team of more than 140 employees, all working toward Yieldstreet’s one goal: change the way people invest for the better.",Yieldstreet,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yieldstreet,For Profit,Yes

"Aerospace, Air Transportation, CleanTech, Industrial","Hollister, California, United States",402,"ZeroAvia is a British and American aviation company founded in 2017 by Val Miftakhov, who also founded the electric vehicle battery startup eMotorWerks. Before founding ZeroAvia, eMotorWerks was acquired by international energy conglomerate Enel. A licensed pilot, Miftakhov saw an opportunity to pursue his dream of flying airplanes while also electrifying them and completely transforming commercial transportation. ZeroAvia developed a vision to serve as a responsible steward of the environment by bringing hydrogen-powered aircraft to the market. The hydrogen-electric powertrain technology vastly reduces carbon emissions and reduces noise, all while lowering fuel and maintenance costs for airlines. For ZeroAvia's promising HyFlyer I project, the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) delivered the fueling systems necessary for test flights as well as infrastructure designed for airports. The HyFlyer II project will carry more passengers and fly up to 500 miles, with the ambitious goal of seating up to 100 passengers and traveling more than 1,000 miles by 2030. As consumer preferences shift toward other methods of travel due to concerns about sustainability, and with the airline industry battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, ZeroAvia is capitalizing on the need for carbon-free transportation options. British Airways has formed a partnership with ZeroAvia to achieve its net-zero goal by 2050. Upon receiving $21.4 million in series A funding in conjunction with $16.3 million in grant funds from the UK government from the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), ZeroAvia has raised $49.7 million from inception to bring hydrogen fuel cells to the market by 2023.",ZeroAvia,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zeroavia-inc,For Profit,Yes
